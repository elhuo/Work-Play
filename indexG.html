                                Arthur represents the future of Britain, a promise of prosperity and honor, yet hidden
                                among his brave warriors are Mordred's unscrupulous minions.

                                These forces of evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain
                                hidden from all but one of Arthur's servants.

                                Merlin alone knows the agents of evil, but he must speak of this only in riddles. If his
                                true identity is discovered, all will be lost."

                                Fishbowl is a virtual version of a fun (and mostly hilarious) guessing game, designed
                                for any group of all ages! You'll need at least 4 to play, but it only gets more fun
                                with more players. Hop on a video call, and play through rounds of Taboo, Charades, and
                                Password.

                                sure to stockpile on masks in order to survive the pandemic - and remember other players
                                will steal from you too.

                                Two rival spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates know the
                                agents only by their CODENAMES.

                                In Codenames, two teams compete to see who can make contact with all of their agents
                                first. Spymasters give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board.
                                Their teammates try to guess words of the right color while avoiding those that belong
                                to the opposing team. And everyone wants to avoid the assassin.

                                Codenames: Win or lose, it's fun to figure out the clues.
